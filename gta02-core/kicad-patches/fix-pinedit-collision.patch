When working with a component that contains multiple independent units,
KiCad warns about pin locations being occupied even if the conflicting
pin is in a different unit.

I've attached a patch that suppresses the warning if the pins are in
different units and if we're in pin-by-pin mode, and thus conflicts
can neither occur at the GUI nor in the underlying model.
