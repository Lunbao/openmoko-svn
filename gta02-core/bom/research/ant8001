ANT8001, U1: Wavefar WTE06016

We have no data sheet of this ISM band antenna. Its size is about
6.0 x 8.4 x 3 mm.

There are many chip antennas for the ISM (2.4-2.5 GHz) band, usually
of smaller size. Impedance is generally 50 Ohm, but we don't know
what gain to use.

A smaller antenna may require more attention with regard to separation
from the ground plane.

In any case, it seems very unlikely that an exact replacement can be
found.

Comment from Joerg: this type of bulky antenna is uncommon today
Comment from Joachim: he remembers the gain of a vaguely similar
  antenna to be around 1.2 dB
