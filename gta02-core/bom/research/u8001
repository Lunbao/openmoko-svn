U8001: Aiconn WM3236AQ

http://www.aiconn.com.tw/newsite/product_001.htm

Aiconn [is] a subsidiary of [...] Accton Technology

They say the WS178Q is a pin-compatible enhancement of the WM3236AQ, and
it has indeed exactly the same size. But the internals and its software
interfaces may still be different. E.g., it almost certainly contains an
AR6002.
