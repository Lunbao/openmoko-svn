U7604: Ricoh R3113D241A-TR-F

research needed.

R3113D241A-TR-F     LNR-IC V-DETECTOR R3113D241A-TR-F 2.4V SON1408-3 3PIN

Before starting the search for a replacement, why do we actually need a
reset generator ?

- the ATR635 data sheet shows in Figure 3-2 that the chip should work
  even without connecting NRESET at all.

- even if we need an external reset for some reason, couldn't we just
  use a GPIO (from the 1.8 V domain, GPAx), perhaps with some EMI filter
  to prevent inter-can pollution ?

The Panasonic MN13821SGP might be a suitable replacement.

		Package		Threshold	Min Vdd
R3113D241A	SON-1408-3	2.4 V		0.45 V ?
MN13821SGP	MINI-3DC, 3x3mm	2.4 V		1.5 V
