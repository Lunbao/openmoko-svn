U1702: Richtek RT9013-12PB

The RT9013 is used to regulate IO_1V8 down to STBY_1V2. Interestingly,
the chip is specified with a minimum input voltage of 2.2 V. However,
this seems to contradict the Vdrop of 250 mV. The data sheet doesn't
indicate how to resolve this conflict.

Alternatives with the same package, similar pinout, but a lower minimum
input voltage, and a lower maximum current:

- ON Semiconductor NCP585DSN12T1G or NCP585HSN12T1G

  (note: pin 4 is NC in the RT9013 but "ECO" in the NCP585)

- ST Microelectronics LD39015M12R

  (perfect replacement)

		Package		Vmin	Vdrop	Imax	Iquiet	Caps	Enable
RT9013-12PB	SOT-23-5	2.2 V	250 mV	500 mA	25 uA	2 x 1uF	H
NCP585DSN12T1G	SOT-23-5	1.4 V	~400 mV	300 mA	80 uA	2 x 1uF	H
LD39015M12R	SOT-23-5	1.5 V	 80 mV	150 mA	38 uA	2 x 1uF	H


Samsung's Power Design Guide, Rev. 1.1, specifies Vdd(alive) to be
1.5 mA in NORMAL or IDLE mode, without indicating whether this is a
typical or maximum value. In any case, U1702 doesn't have to deliver
more than a few mA.
