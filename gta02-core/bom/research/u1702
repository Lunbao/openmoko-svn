U1702: Richtek RT9013-12PB

The RT9013 is used to regulate IO_1V8 down to STBY_1V2. Interestingly,
the chip is specified with a minimum input voltage of 2.2 V. However,
this seems to contradict the Vdrop of 250 mV. The data sheet doesn't
indicate how to resolve this conflict.

Alternatives with the same package, similar pinout, but a lower minimum
input voltage, and a lower maximum current:

- ON Semiconductor NCP585DSN12T1G or NCP585HSN12T1G

  (note: pin 4 is NC in the RT9013 but "ECO" in the NCP585)
