U4902: TI SN74AUP1G00DCKR

- part is listed at major distributors but generally not stocked:

  - Digi-Key has part but with insufficient stock.
    Part is Non-Stock, with 1 week lead time.

  - Arrow lists part with 8 weeks lead time and minimum order 3000.

  - Newark lists part with 90 days lead time and minimum order 6000.

- alternatively, we could change to the YZP (BGA) package, which has
  better availability and is very similar to NXP's 6-XSON for the same
  chip.
