Parts list (.par)
------------------

A parts file lists the parts that are suitable for a given BOM item.
The file begins with a line containing only
#PAR

After this, each line contains the component reference, a space, and
then one or more namespace part-number groups, separated by spaces as
well.

Blank lines and comments (#) are ignored.


Order list (.ord)
-----------------

An order file lists the quantities to order from inventories, along
with the cost and the component references the item is used for. The
file begins with a line containing only
#ORD

After this, each line contains the supplier (namespace), the reference
number, the number of items to order, the currency code, the cost,
and one or more component references.

Blank lines and comments (#) are ignored.


Equivalence (.equ)
------------------

Equivalence files establish equivalences between parts numbers in the
same or in different name spaces. An equivalence file begins with a
line containing only
#EQU

After this, each line consists of the following four space-separated
fields:

namespace-1 part-number-1 namespace-2 part-number-2

Blank lines and comments (#) are ignored.


Inventory (.inv)
----------------

Inventory files list inventory and component cost. An inventory file
begins with a line containing only
#INV

After this, each line contains the namespace and the part number,
followed by the number of items in stock, the currency code, and one
or more pricing entries.

Each pricing entry consists of two fields: the number of items in an
order, and the per item price at that quantity. A sequence of
increasing order sizes indicates that they are quanta. A sequence of
decreasing order sizes indicates that smaller quanta are possible
after a previous larger threshold has been met.

Example:

... USD 1 0.5 10 0.4 100 0.2

Means that an order of at least 170 units would be made either as
2 * 100 units, costing USD 40, or as 1 * 100 + 7 * 10 units, costing
USD 20 + USD 28 = USD 48.

If the entry is

... USD 1 0.5 10 0.4 100 0.2 1 0.2

Then the USD 0.2 per unit cost would apply to any any quantity of at
least 100 units. So a 170 units order would cost USD 34.

Blank lines and comments (#) are ignored.
