Replace Calypso with Telit GE865


Remove the whole Calypso circuit and use a Telit GE865-QUAD module instead.

Issues:
- check that UART connectivity is okay (levels and such)
- check control signals (power on/off, reset, interrupt, etc.)
- check battery connection (voltage, current)
- height will interfere with WLAN daughterboard
- height will interfere with white plastic structure holding rear speaker 
- firmware update capabilities - probably through test pads only, hence drop DL_GSM


New and renamed nets:
 - MODEM_MON. Monitor on/off status of modem.  Connect to nXDREQ0/GPB10
 - MODEM_WAKE (renamed from INT0)
 - MODEM_INT  (renamed from IO1)
 - MODEM_nRFKILL (maybe)
 - SIM_INSERT Short to ground when Sim is inserted.
