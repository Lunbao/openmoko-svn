Replace Calypso with Telit GE865


Remove the whole Calypso circuit and use a Telit GE865-QUAD module instead.

Issues:
- check that UART connectivity is okay (levels and such)
- check control signals (power on/off, reset, interrupt, etc.)
- check battery connection (voltage, current)
- height will interfere with WLAN daughterboard
- height will interfere with white plastic structure holding rear speaker 
- firmware update capabilities - probably through combination of SERVICE and RX/TX.

Use of a capacitor on VRTC pin provides RTC continuity when power is removed 
from the rest of the device.  A precise calculation for the capacitor size is 
not possible as the docs do not include a current consumtion figure (Irev) for 
the GE865.  Irev for the GE863 is 2uA and 1.6uA for the GE864.  Assuming a 
worse case of 2uA for the GE865, a 220uF capacitor will provide approx 1.5 
minutes of RTC during battery swaps.

Replace GSM Power switch (U1705) with NTGD1100L, remove GSM_ON net.
Route MODEM_ON and MODEM_RST to open-drain GPIO's on PMU
Allow only for the internal antenna


New and renamed nets:
 - MODEM_MON. Monitor modem status.  Connect to nXDREQ0/GPB10
 - MODEM_WAKE (renamed from INT0) - CPU wakes / sleeps modem
 - MODEM_INT  (renamed from IO1)  - modem wakes CPU
 - MODEM_SERVICE 
 - SIM_INSERT Short to ground when Sim is inserted.
