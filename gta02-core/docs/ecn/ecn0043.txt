Assorted audio cleanup


A number of components are leftovers from earlier designs and experiments,
and don't serve a purpose anymore. We can thus safely remove them.

They are:

- C4307: unlike the "buzzfix" capacitor C4306 that stabilizes MICBIAS in
  the presence of interferences, the filter capacitor on MIC2 (C4307)
  serves no purpose

- R3004 and R3005: since we don't perceive a need to cut off the speaker,
  these 0R resistors in the speaker audio path serve no real purpose and
  should be removed
