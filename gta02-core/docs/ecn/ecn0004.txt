Remove R1767 and R1768 and connect all PMU.EXTONx to R1766


The PMU's inputs EXTON1, EXTON2, and EXTON3 are not used in GTA02. Each
of them has an individual pull-up to VB_SYS. Even if EXTONx were used
in some embedded application, one such input should be sufficient.

We can therefore reduce the number of components by connecting all
EXTONx pins to each other and letting them share a single pull-up.
