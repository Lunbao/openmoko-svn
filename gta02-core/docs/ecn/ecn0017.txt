Move Bluetooth module (U2) to main PCB


In all GTA01 devices since GTA01Bv3 and all GTA02 devices, the Bluetooth
module resided on an FPC mounted on the main shield. This complicates
assembly and introduces production risk. Furthermore, the Bluetooth FPCs
had at least at some point in time a low yield, further complicating
production.

With the removal of the second acceleration sensor and the ability to
relocate (remove ?) the backup battery, we now have room for placing the
Bluetooth circuit on the main PCB, like it was done in GTA01Bv2.
