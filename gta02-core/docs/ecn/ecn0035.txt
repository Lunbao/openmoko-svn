Kill WLAN unused RF components


WLAN module has 3 unused components on RF path: R7801, C7802' and
C7803'. R7801 is a 0R resistor, and the caps are not used.

These components do interfere with RF trace impedance, causing
attenuations and signal shifts. 

Remove these components from design, thus allowing for better
signal reception and transmission.
