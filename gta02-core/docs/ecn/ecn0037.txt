Route ROUT1/LOUT1 back to LINE1/LINE2 input


In Joerg's GTA03 proposal he connected the stereo line from the headset jack
back to the line inputs of the codec. So you are able to connect a line 
compatible audio source to it and record or process the audio stream within the
phone.


We need to connect the codec side of the coupling capacitors C4110 and C4411 
trough a 1k series resistor (R3030/R3031) to the line input (LINE1 and LINE2)
of the codec. To be within the standard of line compatible audio inputs we need
to increase the input impedance to 10k Ohm for a low impedance input. Therefore
we have to change R4416 and R4417 to at least 10k. 

Note: In general the input impedance for a regular line input (high impedance)
is around 47k Ohm. We cannot change R4416/4417 to 47k Ohm as required because 
we need a proper pulldown for the jack insert detection. The voltage divider 
is formed out of the codec's internal 100k Ohm pull-up the 10k Ohm series 
resistance R4402 and the pulldown resistor R4116. If we increase R4416 to 47k 
Ohm the low level voltage would be around 1.2V, the codec maximum low level is
at 0.8V so we would not be able to generate an interrupt during jack insert.

Comments:
To use this feature you would still need a special (probably self made) adapter
cable, because a 2.5mm audio jack is very uncommon for any audio equipment.
