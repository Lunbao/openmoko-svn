Remove audio amplifier (U4101)


The Wolfson codec is able to drive a mono 8 OHM speaker so there is no need for
a separate power amplifier. Therefore the output section of the audio subsystem
gets heavily reconstructed.

Removing the external amplifier (U4101) as well as the amplifier specific
components R4114 (pull-up HP_IN), R4112, R4115 (feedback), R4109 (pull-up 
AMP_SHUT), R4108 (power supply IO_3V3), R4110, R4113 (input), C4117 (bypass),
C4114 and C4115 (input decoupling). Also there is no need for the AMP_SHUTDOWN
and HP_IN signals any more,the external speaker and headphone can be fully 
controlled by the corresponding register settings of the codec. (see [1])

The GTA02 earpiece will be connected between OUT3 and LOUT1 of the codec, there
will be no change of the filter and bypass capacitors.

The external speaker will be connected directly between ROUT2 and LOUT2.
Filter, capacitors, and varistors will not be changed or replaced.

The external headphone will be connected between ROUT1 and LOUT1.
The common mode choke B4102 will be removed with ECN0032.

R4404 (MIC_BIAS pull down, NC) does not seem to have any special purpose, 
therefore it can be removed to free more space in the already crowded area of 
the hs jack.

Since HPVDD and SPKRVDD may draw about 150 mA in normal operation,
CODEC_3V3 needs to be supplied from a more powerful source than LDO2
(limited to 50 mA). We can use LDO4 (capable of supplying 150 mA) if
we move BT_3V2 to LDO2. The Bluetooth modules draws only up to 35 mA,
so the 50 mA of LDO2 are sufficient.

Testing [2] showed that shorting LDO4 will cause it to limit the current
to about 500 mA, which is still low enough to prevent immediate problems
for the rest of the system.

Open issue: do we continue feeding LDOs 3 and 4 from Vsys or do we move
them to IO_3V3 for better efficiency ? (In the latter case, AVDD etc al.
would have to operate at 3.05 V or less, due to the 250 mV voltage drop
of the LDO.) [3]
