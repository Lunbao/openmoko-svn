Remove audio amplifier (U4101)


The Wolfson codec is able to drive a mono 8 OHM speaker so there is no need for
a separate power amplifier. Therefore the output section of the audio subsystem
gets heavily reconstructed.

Removing the external amplifier (U4101) as well as the amplifier specific
components R4114, R4112, R4109, R4108, R4110, R4113, C4117, C4111, C4110, C4110
and C4115. Also there is no need for the AMP_SHUTDOWN and HP_IN signals anymore, the external
speaker and headphone can be fully controlled by the corresponding register settings of the
codec. (see [1])

The GTA02 earpiece will be connected between OUT3 and ROUT1 of the codec, there will be
no change on the filter and bypass capacitors.

The external speaker will be connected directly between ROUT2 and LOUT2.
Filter and capacitors will be the same.

TODO:
- Headphone switch to GPIO4
- massive change of components (C4405,R4405 etc) headphone jack,
  improve audio quality for low impedance headsets at low frequencies
- reason for varistor on EP_L line
- maybe increase the pull down resistors (R4117 and R4116) for high 
  impedance headphones (Z >= 2k OHM).
