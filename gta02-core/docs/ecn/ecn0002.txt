Remove NOR (U2501)

Remove U2501
Remove U2502

Remove signals GCS0, GCS3, nNOR_WP, nFLASH_CE, nOE 

Note that the connection from IO_1V8 via R2504 to FLASH_1V8 (sheet 25xx 
f the Openmoko GTA02 schematics) remains for the NAND in the CPU.

To do:
- software impact of not having NOR on Qi and kernel
