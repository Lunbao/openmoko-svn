Remove NOR (U2501)

Remove U2501
Remove U2502

Remove signals GCS0, GCS3, nNOR_WP, nFLASH_CE, nOE 

Note that the connection from IO_1V8 via R2504 to FLASH_1V8 (sheet 25xx 
of the Openmoko GTA02 schematics) remains for the NAND in the CPU.

Software impact: Qi must pass an "mtdparts=" parameter without the
"physmap-flash" entry and the kernel must not register a NOR device
(arch/arm/mach-s3c2442/mach-gta02.c:gta02_devices).

On the Linux side, the absence of NOR means that the MTD device numbers
change. However, if we assume a legacy-free configuration (i.e., no
u-boot), the partition layout changes anyway, and only a single Qi
partition is needed for now. (Later, "factory" data may be stored as
well.)
