Changing internal microphone to symmetrical configuration

According to Joerg, the internal microphone was switched to an asymmetrical 
configuration in GTA02-Rev06. It was expected that this would influence the 
noise (Buzz) dramatically. However a real improvement of the noise could not be
achieved.

In most cases a symmetrical configuration offers a better common mode noise 
rejection than an asymmetrical one. Therefore it is prefered to operate the 
internal microphone in a symmetrical configuration.

Changes:
	- replace R4304 with a 2k2 resistor
