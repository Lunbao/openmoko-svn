Move 0R resistors next to PMU after caps


Each power supply leaving the PMU connects through a 0R resistor
and then to a group of buffer (> 1 uF) and filter capacitors
(typically < 1 uF).

Joerg suggested that at least the filter capacitors - and possibly
also the buffer capacitors - should be moved to the PMU side of
the 0R resistor, since they're supposed to filter noise originating
from the PMU.
