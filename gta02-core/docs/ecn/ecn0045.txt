Zero stock component replacements


The following components are no longer available in FIC's inventory
and need to be sourced or replaced no matter how we proceed:

- ANT8101, CON8001: Murata MM8430-2610RB3, antenna connector GSM, WLAN
- CON1701: Octek BTP-03JA4G, battery connector
- CON4702, CON6001: Hirose FH23-39S-0.3SHW(05), FPC connector for LCM and debug
- CON7501: Proconn SMSN16-J0-2214, SIM/uSD combi holder
- CON7601: Hirose U.FL-R-SMT-1(10), GPS antenna connector
- JK4401: Nuconn JAR02-062101, 2.5 mm audio jack
- SPK4102: PPR06-023104, dual pogo pin
- U1701: NXP PCF50633HN/04/N3,5, PMU
- U2201: Samsung K4M51323PC-DG75, mobile SDRAM
- U3001: Wolfson WM8753LGEFL, audio codec
- U4902: TI SN74AUP1G00DCKR, NAND gate
- U4904: Analogic Tech AAT1275IRN-5.0-T1, boost converter for USB host
- U7601: Atmel ATR0635-7KQY, GPS receiver
- U7802: STM LIS302DL, acceleration sensor
- resistors (all 0402):
  - 1% 12.5 kOhm, 39 kOhm
  - 5%: 220 Ohm
- capacitors:
  - 0402 NP0: 8.2 pF, 15 pF, 22 pF, 100 pF, 220 pF
  - 0402 X5R/X7R: 820 pF, 1 uF 6.3 V
  - 0603 X5R/X7R: 2.2 uF 10 V, 4.7 uF 6.3 V
  - 0805 Y5V: 10 uF 0805

For all the resistors and capacitors, suitable replacements have been
found. The connectors by Murata and Hirose are available at Digi-Key,
and so is the acceleration sensor.

U3001, U4902, and U7802 can be purchased from major distributors as
well.

U2201 [1] (13.0 x 11.0 x 1.0 mm) can be replaced with the
pin-compatible Micron MT48H16M32LFCM-75:B [2] (13.0 x 10.0 x 1.0 mm).

The PMU (U1701) and the GPS receiver (U7601) have proven difficult to
source so far. For details, see bom/research/u1701 and
bom/research/u7601

The remaining items are apparently not carried by any major
distributors and need to be substituted with reasonably similar parts:

- It may be possible to obtain samples for the boost converter U4904,
  or to buy directly from the manufacturer. There are also several
  similar parts, but all differ in the external circuit elements. See
  bom/research/u4904 for details.

- There is a battery connector similar to CON1701, although lower and
  with shorter contacts. It may be possible to find a more similar part
  by searching some more. See bom/research/con1701 for details.

- We have an excellent replacement for the SIM/uSD card holder CON7501.
  Its only drawbacks are a slightly different footprint and a different
  pin assignment. See bom/research/con7501 for details.

- The search for a replacement for audio jack JK4401 has been
  remarkably unsuccessful so far. All functionally equivalent
  replacements are considerably larger. Even if we'd consider going to
  a 3.5 mm stereo jack, without microphone, there may be no part short
  enough to not conflict with the battery connector. See
  bom/research/jk4401 for details.

- The dual pogo pin SPK4102 depends on the contacts of the speaker.
  This still needs looking at.

Recommended actions:

- U3001, U4902, U7802, Murata, Hirose: use original parts
- U2201, CON7501, resistors, capacitors: replace as indicated above
- U1701, U7601: keep on searching
- CON1701, JK4401: it would be great if someone could find parts more
  similar to the respective original. If not, we'll have to see if we
  can find a combination that works reasonably well.
- SPK4102: to be defined
