Connect CLKOUT1 to UEXTCLK (U1501)


Routing CLOCKOUT1 to UEXTCLK would allow the serial ports to use the USB
clock as input to the clock dividers. This would come in handy when using
frequency scaling, because we can't usually avoid glitching any of the
internally available clock sources on frequency changes. Suggested by Cesar
