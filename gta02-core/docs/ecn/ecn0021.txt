Use EMI-hardened microphone (MC4301)


For GTA02v8, an EMI-hardened version of the microphone was specified.

The new microphone has a different form factor and needs some of the
plastic to be cut. We also don't know about component availability.
While this change is probably too intrusive for gta02-core, it may be
considered for future versions.
