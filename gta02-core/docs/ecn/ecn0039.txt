Insert 0R resistors into SPI signals


The SC32442B SPI interface running at 13 MHz or faster has timing problems[1]
that we might need to patch up externally. Following ECN0001 (Glamo removal)
and ECN0034 the SPI interface exposed at the debug connector will now be routed
to the alternative SPI1 pins of the LCD interface. There is some uncertainty
about the SPICLK1 signal there[2]. Finally, the SPI1 pins currently routed to the
accelerometer have EINT capability while the debug connector ones do not, so to
make better use of EINT pins, we should find out if the two sets of SPI pins can
be swapped.

The change is to insert a 0R resistor into all the SPI signals:

SPICLK0/GPE13
SPIMOSI0/GPE12
SPIMISO0/GPE11
EINT11/nSS1/GPG3
EINT13/SPIMISO1/GPG5
EINT14/SPIMOSI1/GPG6
EINT15/SPICLK1/GPG7
VD9/SPICLK1/GPD1
VD17/SPIMOSI1/GPD9
VD16/SPIMISO1/GPD8

Impact: We won't likely have enough 0R resistors supplied by OM and therefore
need to buy some.
