Route additional SPI/GPIO pins to debug connector


The gta02 debug connector exposed un unused SPI set, which is now 
used by WLAN.  The sc32442 contains only two SPI controllers, used 
for WLAN and Accelerometers in gta02-core.  However, the pins used 
for these devices can be dissabled (configured as GPIO) and further
pins can then be assigned to the SPI function.

These additional pins can be used as GPIO, or switched to SPI if 
the accelerometer is dissabled.

Changes:
 - route VD17/SPIMOSI1/GPD9, VD16/SPIMISO1/GPD8, VD9/SPICLK1/GPD1,
   and VD8/nSPICS1/GPD0 to pins 10,11,12 on the debug connector

 - move HDQ from VD8/nSPICS1/GPD0 to VD0/GPC8

 - move LCD_nRES from VD17/SPIMOSI1/GPD9 to VD1/GPC9

LCD_nRES and HDQ have both been moved since gta02 to accomodate the
lcm move, and if this ecn is implimented their new locations should
be noted in the relevant orginal ecn's

It would be possible to also free up EINT11/nSS1/GPG3, which was 
unused in gta02 and is currently used by WLAN_INT.  This could be 
moved to EINT7 or EINT8
