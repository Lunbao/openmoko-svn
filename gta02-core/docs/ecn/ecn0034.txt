Route additional SPI/GPIO pins to debug connector


The gta02 debug connector exposed un unused SPI set, which is now 
used by WLAN.  The sc32442 contains only two SPI controllers, used 
for WLAN and Accelerometers in gta02-core.  However, the pins used 
for these devices can be dissabled (configured as GPIO) and further
pins can then be assigned to the SPI function.

These additional pins can be used as GPIO, or switched to SPI if 
the accelerometer is dissabled.

Changes:
 - move HDQ from VD8/nSPICS1/GPD0 to nXBACK/GPB5
 - move LCD_nRES from VD17/SPIMOSI1/GPD9 to LEND/GPC0
 - move WLAN_INT from EINT11/nSS1/GPG3 to EINT8/GPG0
 - route VD17/SPIMOSI1/GPD9, VD16/SPIMISO1/GPD8, VD9/SPICLK1/GPD1,
   EINT11/nSS1/GPG3 and VD8/nSPICS1/GPD0 to pins 8-12 on the
   debug connector

LCD_nRES, WLAN_INT and HDQ have both been moved since gta02 to accomodate the
lcm move, and if this ecn is implimented their new locations should
be noted in the relevant orginal ecn's
