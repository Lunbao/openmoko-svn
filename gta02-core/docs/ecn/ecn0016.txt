Remove upper acceleration sensor (U7801)


Despite many claims that two acceleration sensors provide enhanced
sensing capabilities, one year after the introduction of GTA02, no
application seems to make use of both sensors. We can therefore
conclude that the second sensor is of little or no practical use.

Items to remove:
- Upper Acceleration Sensor (U7801)
- Other related passives (R7802, R7809, R7809, C7801, C7802)

Items to add:
- NC pullup resistor to second interrupt (INT2) of remaining sensor

Changes:
- Moved CS signal of remaining sensor to GPG0
- No, since we have only one sensor now, we don't need CS anymore.
  Connect to GND, remove the nACCEL_CS net, free EINT8/GPG0, and remove
  R7810.
- Connected INT2 of remaining sensor to GPG8 (formerly INT1 of other sensor)

To do:
- why the upper ?

- connect both interrupts (motivation)
