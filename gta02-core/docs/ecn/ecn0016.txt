Remove upper acceleration sensor (U7801)


Despite many claims that two acceleration sensors provide enhanced
sensing capabilities, one year after the introduction of GTA02, no
application seems to make use of both sensors. We can therefore
conclude that the second sensor is of little or no practical use.

Items to remove:
- Upper Acceleration Sensor (U7801)
- Other related passives (R7802, R7809, R7809, C7801, C7802)

Items to add:
- NC pullup resistor to second interrupt (INT2) of remaining sensor

To do:
- why the upper ?
- connect both interrupts (motivation)
