Remove backup battery (BAT1701)


The backup battery is a problematic device: it's large, difficult to
solder, and it's prone to aging. Replacing a defective backup battery
is difficult at best.

If we could avoid having a backup battery at all, this would improve
the reliability of the entire system.

Furthermore, a working backup battery prevents the PMU from entering
NoPower state, so some of the PMU settings may or may not be preserved
when main battery and USB power are removed. We can neither assume that
settings different from NoPower defaults have been preserved, nor can
we assume that they have. This complicates the overall power on
behaviour and may introduce subtle problems.

From a software point of view, having a single well-defined power on
state would therefore be beneficial.

We depend on the backup battery for powering the RTC clock in the PMU.
This clock is also supplied if the PMU is in Standby mode, running from
USB or main battery. We therefore only need the backup battery if there
is no USB power and main battery has either cut itself off or is absent.

Software could preserve time by synchronizing the modem's RTC with the
system time, and setting the PMU's RTC from that source if starting from
NoPower.

Furthermore, time information can be obtained via GPS, sometimes GSM,
and - if Internet connectivity is available - also via NTP.

According to the formula given in Telit's RTC Application Note (can't
find it anymore ?!?), a 100 uF capacitor would supply the modem's RTC
for one minute, which should be sufficient for battery removal.
