Limit non-ESD overvoltage on USB_VBUS (U4905)


The issue: the highest USB voltage the PMU is specied for is 5.5 V,
which makes it not very tolerant to USB overvoltage. Excessive USB
voltage may come from defective power supplies and supplies with
loose design tolerances, such as car chargers.

The RT9711 only provides overcurrent protection but no overvoltage
protection. A better choice would be the TI BQ24314DSG:

Joerg Reisenweber has designed a circuit using the BQ24314DSG:

Defer this to post-gta02-core since it requires a new part and it's
not an emergency.
