Current rating of backlight LED inductor (L1704)


The inductor of the boost converter for the backlight LED is currently
rated at 800 mA. Such a part is hard to source in a 0805 package.

The average current through the LED should only be 30 mA or less (LCM
specification). Since this is a boost converter, the peak current
through the inductor is considerably larger than the average output
current. Unfortunately, the PMU manual does not indicate by which
factor.

The PMU had an over-current protection that can be configured to either
500 mA or 1 A (default, resets in Standby). u-boot sets it to 500 mA
while Qi and the kernel both seem to leave it unchanged.

It thus seems that 500 mA are sufficient for normal operation.

Another consideration is the power lost due to the inductor's resistance.
Inductors with a high current rating also tend to have a low resistance.

If a 800 mA and 0805 part is too difficult to source, we therefore have
two choices:

1) use a part with the same footprint but rated at a lower current, e.g.,
   TAIYO-YUDEN LQM21PN2R2MC0D T=L  L=2.2uH TOL=20% R=340mR I=600mA FP=0805

2) increase the footprint to allow for a part rated at a higher current,
   e.g.,
   TAIYO-YUDEN BRL3225T2R2M T=L    L=2.2uH TOL=20% R=78mR  I=1.85A FP=1210

Note that we already use the BRL3225T2R2M for L1701 and L4901, so option
2) would be cost-neutral.
