Remove LED transistors (Q1501 and Q1502)


LED1501 is a Harvatek HT-210UD/NB [1]. To determine the forward current
If through each LED, we need to calculate If = (IO_3V3-Vf)/220R, where
Vf is a function of If as specified by the data sheet.

Graphical approximation suggests that If(amber) = 7 mA and
If(blue) = 2 mA.

LED1502 is a Harvatek HT-110USD5 [2]. Using the same approximation, we
obtain also If(red) = 7 mA.

The I/O pads GPB0 through GPB2 are all of type t8, capable of sinking
or sourcing at least 8 mA, with Ron <= 50 Ohm. The GPIOs are known to
withstand permanent shorting to ground with a current well in excess
of 50 mA.

We could therefore drive the LEDs directly from the CPU, with the
following component changes:

- change R1562 and R1563 to 150 Ohm (requires a new component). With a
  total series resistance of Ron+150 Ohm, we still don't exceed 8 mA.

- change R1561 to 0 Ohm or small nominal value (e.g., 33 Ohm, like the
  now obsolete R1812). Even with just Ron, Vf should still be around
  3.0 V and the current should thus not exceed 6 mA.

- remove Q1501, Q1502, and R1564

- connect R1561 directly to GPB1, R1562 to GPB2, and R1562 to GPB2

Note that this change reverses the logic of the LEDs: to activate
them, they have to be driven low. To deactivate, they have to be
driven high or Z. This also means that the LEDs will be dimly lit
immediately after reset, when the weak pull-downs are enabled.

Software changes are required in Qi and the kernel to accommodate
this change.

The original GTA02 logic could be preserved for LED1502 by reversing
it and connecting it to GND instead of IO_3V#, and for LED1501 by
replacing it with a common-cathode type (if such a component exists).

Review: Dave Ball <openmoko@daveball.org.uk>, rev5338, reverse the logic 
	for gta02-core, less hassle than sourcing new LED's.
