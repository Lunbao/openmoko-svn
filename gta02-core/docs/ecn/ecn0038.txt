Loudspeaker EMI filter


To protect the codec from incoming interferences it would be more efficient to
place the filter caps C4119-C4122 and C4128 on the codec side of the common 
mode coke. So they act in combination with B4105 as a lowpass filter who 
removes incoming RF on the audio lines. I also would combine R4119/20 and 
R4121/22 (39pF+18pF) to one 47pF capacitor (like the EMI filter in the earpiece
path) so we can remove at least one unique component from the BOM.

To do:
I do not see any particular reason why C4128 is 10pF it's there since GTA01.
This needs to be clarified because this value is rarely used (vibrator) in GTA02
schematics and might be worth replacing it.
