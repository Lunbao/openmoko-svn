Apply bass fix


The GTA02 has a 1uF cap in the left and right audio path of the
headphone, these caps act in combination with the headphone as high-pass
filter, so they will attenuate the lower frequencies. For a headphone with
32 Ohm impedance the resulting cutoff frequency will be 2.45kHz (incl. 33 Ohm
internal R). This result in a poor audio quality if listening to music.

Unfortunately we cannot switch to the dc coupled (capless) design because we
share a common ground with the microphone. In capless mode we would be unable
to bias the microphone properly. To solve this issue we would need a headset
with a separate ground for microphone and headphone as well as a different
headset jack.

To improve the audio quality we need to replace C4111 and C4110 with a 100uF
polarized tantalum capacitor so the lower cutoff frequency with a 32 Ohm 
headphone will be at 50Hz.
(assumed R4407 & R4405 = 0R, see ECN0015 "Remove Calypso serial interface on
headset")
