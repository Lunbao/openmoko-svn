Remove Calypso serial interface on headset (U4401)


The Calypso serial interface on the headset port caused many problem. 

Changes:
- removed U4401
- changed R4407 and R4405 from 33 Ohm to 0 Ohm. These resistors probably kept
  the input signal from shorting through the amplifier, so there is no need
  for them anymore. (Remove them completely ?)
- removed TP4405/4406
- removed R4403, pulldown resistor for U4401 enable lines 
- remove R4411 and TP4402/4401 as well
