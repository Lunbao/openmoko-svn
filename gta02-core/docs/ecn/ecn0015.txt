Remove Calypso serial interface on headset (U4401)


The Calypso serial interface on the headset port caused many problem. 

Changes:
- removed U4401
- removed R4407 and R4408, these resistors probably keept the input signal from
  shorting through the amplifier, so there is no need for them anymore.
- removed TP4405/4406
- removed R4403, pulldown resistor for U4401 enable lines 

To do:
- depending on Calypso replacement we might want to keep/remove R4411 and TP4402/4401 as well
