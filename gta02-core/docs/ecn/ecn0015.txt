Remove Calypso serial interface on headset (U4401)


The Calypso serial interface on the headset port caused many problems. 

Changes:
- removed U4401
- remove R4405 and R4407 (33 Ohm). These resistors probably kept the input
  signal from shorting through the amplifier, so there is no need for them
  anymore.
- removed TP4405/4406
- removed R4403, pulldown resistor for U4401 enable lines 
- remove R4411 and TP4402/4401 as well

Note: with ECN0030, the whole Calypso subsystem gets replaced, so this is
just one first step in the right direction.
