Introduce better bus termination on SDIO data lines / SD-Card.



In early gta02's use of the SD-card generated interference causing GPS 
performance to be poor, including significantly increasing Time To First 
Fix.  With the SD card removed, TTFF was ~2 mins, but with card inserted 
it went up to 10 minutes or more (depending on signal strengths).

A software workaround was introduced that stopped the SDIO clock when SD 
card was not in use, and this proved effective in allowing GPS to function 
correctly while SD card was not in use.

Later GTA02's came with an additional 10pF capacitor between Clk (pin5) and 
Vss (pin6) of the SD card connector.


The root cause of the problem is beieved to be EMF interference from the 
SDIO bus not being properly terminated.


To reduce ds EMF interference in gta02-core, we should:

 - Fit 10pF capacitors in C7501-C7506 (currently NC)

 - reduce 75R series resistors R7503-R7508 to 33R
