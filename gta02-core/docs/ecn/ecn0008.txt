Remove external GPS antenna connector and circuit (CON7602)


Changes to implement in order to remove the external GPS antenna:

- Remove U7606 and C7620
- Merge C7601 and C7630 into a single capacitor.

  Following the reference designs from Atmel and u-blox which put a
  value between 8.6 pF and 47 pF, with the remark that exact values
  depend on the layout, we use 22 pF.

- Remove U7605, R7620, C7623, R7613, R7614, C7629, C7628 (external
  antenna power sense)
- Remove R7615, Q7602 and R7617. Connect R7610 to LNA_AVDD.
- Remove R7617 and C7623 (pull-down and buffer for VCONT)
- Remove CON7602, C7631, and L7609 (external antenna connection)
