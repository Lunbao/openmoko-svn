Either remove or populate R1701 (PMU.ADAPTSNS pull-down)


ADAPTSNS is an input without internal pull-up or pull-down resistor.
We should therefore not let it float. However, it's also debounced,
so letting it float may have no detrimental effect.

GTA02 provides a footprint for a pull-down resistor (R1701) but
doesn't populate it and ADAPTSNS therefore floats. There are no known
issues in GTA02 with letting ADAPTSNS float and we could therefore
remove the R1701 footprint.
