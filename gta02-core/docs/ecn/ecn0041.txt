Test points and 0R resistors for camera interface


We should allow for experimentation with the camera interface. The
24xx/64xx camera interface would be the obvious choice of interface to
connect a camera to, but a few details need verification:

The SC32442B manual specifies a short VSYNC pulse (high) between lines. 
Several camera modules instead keep VSYNC high during lines. It is not clear
from the manual if simply inverting VSYNC polarity is enough to make it
work.

The SC32442B manual isn't quite clear on how to receive e.g. JPEG compressed
data as offered by some cameras. E.g. will we need a separate VSYNC
interrupt pin to deal with variable frame data lengths?

The change is to route unused pins to test points and insert 0R into the
rest. Current status:

CAMDATA0/GPJ0	Insert 0R (BT_PIO5).
CAMDATA1/GPJ1	Add test point.
...
CAMDATA6/GPJ6	Add test point.
CAMDATA7/GPJ7	Insert 0R (WLAN_GPIO0).
CAMPCLK/GPJ8	Add test point.
CAMVSYNC/GPJ9	Add test point.
CAMHREF/GPJ10	Insert 0R (WLAN_DATA2).
CAMCLKOUT/GPJ11	Has 0R and test point (CHIP_PWD).
CAMRESET/GPJ12	Insert 0R (WLAN_nRESET).

CAMRESET is not really a special function, any GPIO could be used for the
camera reset signal.

Would it be better to route the camera signals to the debug connector to save
PCB space and reduce the need to solder wires to the main PCB?

Impact: Little if any. The signals currently routed to the camera port are
less than 1 Hz or not used at all.
