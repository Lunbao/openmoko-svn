Remove USB "charge path" power switch U4905


We can just disable USB host power at the PMU, so U4905 has no real
purpose. Note that an overvoltage-limiting component should be used in
the future, as explained in ECN0014.

Hardware changes:

- remove U4905
- eliminate net USB_VBUS and just call it VBUS (i.e., merge the two)
- remove C4911, C4913, R4920
- remove C4909 (see also ECN0011)
- keep R1918 but move it to the up-converter delivering host mode power
- eliminate net nUSB_OC, freeing GPG9

Software changes:

- when switching to USB host mode, make sure the PMU MBC is in USB
  suspend mode (MBCC7.usbdevstat = 3)
