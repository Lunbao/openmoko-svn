Replace coupling capacitors for input/output lines


Wolfson recommends 1uF coupling capacitors for input and output lines of the 
codec [1]. However in the current GTA02 100nF capacitors are used for coupling.
To follow Wolfson's recommendation we will change all line input/output 
coupling capacitors to 1uF.

Replace the following capacitors with 1uF (CM105X5R105M16AT):
- C4304 and C4303 (MIC input)
- C3007 and C3008 (GSM modem input)
- C3018 and C3011 (GSM modem output)
- C3016 (headset MIC)
