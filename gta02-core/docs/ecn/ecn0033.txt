Replace coupling capacitors for input/output lines


Wolfson recommends 1uF coupling capacitors for input and output lines of the 
codec [1]. However in the current GTA02 100nF capacitors are used for coupling.
To follow Wolfson's recommendation we will change all line input/output 
coupling capacitors to 1uF.

Replace the following capacitors with 1uF/6.3V SMD-0402 :
- C4304 and C4303 (MIC input)
- C3007 and C3006 (GSM modem input)
- C3018 and C3011 (GSM modem output)
- C3016 and C4406 (headset MIC)

Todo:
find a suitable and easy to source capacitor e.g. TDK C1005X5R0J105K (Digi-Key)
or AVX 04026D105KAT2A (Digi-Key & Farnell)
