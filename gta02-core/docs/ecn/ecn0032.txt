Add EMI and ESD protection to headset jack


To prevent destroying the codec from any discharge we need to add a proper 
ESD protection.
We might still get RF feeding through the headset jack into the codec/system. 
To be 100% sure it's best to add low pass EMI filter in all signal lines of the
headset jack.

based on Joerg's proposal!

ESD protection 
- add varistors (D4403/4404/4405) 5.6Vac to all headset jack signal pins
  (same as D4402)

EMI protection 
- add Pi-filter to all signal lines of the headset jack 
  C1=47pF C2=47pF B=KLB0603K601SA (see ecn0032/pi-filter.png)
  possible references C4408-C4415, B4415-B4429
- remove 22pF capacitors C4403/4404/4405
- remove common mode choke B4102 

Todo:
cutoff frequency and attenuation at 2GHz with KLB0603K601SA needs to be verified
(looks like impedance will be to low around 2GHz).
