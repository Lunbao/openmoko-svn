Add EMI and ESD protection to headset jack


To prevent destroying the codec from any discharge we need to add a proper
ESD protection.
We might still get RF feeding through the headset jack into the codec/system.
To be 100% sure it's best to add low pass EMI filter in all signal lines of the
headset jack.

based on Joerg's proposal!

ESD protection
- add varistors (D4403/4404/4405) 5.6Vac to all headset jack signal pins
  (same as D4402)

EMI protection 
- add Pi-filter to all signal lines of the headset jack 
  (see ecn0032/pi-filter.png)
  C1=47pF C2=47pF B=BLM15HD102SN1 1R25(DC) 
  possible references C4408-C4415, B4415-B4419
- remove 22pF capacitors C4403/4404/4405
- remove common mode choke B4102 

attenuation: f=1..3GHz approx 55dB(IN)/68dB(OUT) (150pF varistor)
