Simplify/remove BAT_ID/BATTEMP circuit (R1769)


Since BAT_ID is used for HDQ in GTA02, the analog battery temperature
monitor is no longer used. We can therefore remove R1769, which is NC.

Perhaps we can also remove R1705, which is a unique component. Neither
Qi, u-boot, nor the kernel set MBCC7.battempena, so no attempt is made
to measure the battery temperature or let it affect the charger state.
It should therefore be safe to remove R1705 as well.
