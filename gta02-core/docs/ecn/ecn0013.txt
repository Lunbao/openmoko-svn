Increase rated current of B4902


B4902 is a KarMax KLB0603K601SA that is only rated at 800 mA (if the
"K" is to be believed. The table on the second page of [1] suggests
even a value as low as 200 mA.)

When using the wall charger, the PMU may draw up to 1000 mA. The
effect of B4902 overheating can be dramatic, as shown in [2].

Beads with a higher current rating but otherwise similar
characteristics - including the same form factor - are readily
available, e.g., the Murata BLM18KG601SN1D [3], which is rated at
1.3 A.

Despite the obviously incorrect dimensioning, there appears to be
only one case where B4902 did indeed fail. To keep sourcing for
gta02-core simple, we should therefore defer this change.
