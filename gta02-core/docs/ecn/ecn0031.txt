Use codec to detect jack insertion and HOLD button


The Wolfson WM8753L has the ability to detect jack insertion and pressing
the HOLD button (MIC bias short-circuit).

Rough outline:
- HOLD seems to be internal, ok
- route JACK_INSERT to the codec (GPIO4), not the CPU
- route codec IRQ (GP1) to CPU

Q: how do we distinguish multiple interrupt sources ? Mask and see if
the interrupt persists ? Or would we have to upgrade to a 3-wire interface
so that we could read data back ? (Seems too intrusive.)
