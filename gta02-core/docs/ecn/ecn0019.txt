Consider applying buzz fix


RF feeds into the microphone line of the headset jack JK4401. This RF causes
ripples on the microphone bias line of the codec which leads to a poor audio
quality of the microphone.
One goal of ECN0018 is to prevent any RF from reaching the wolfson codec,
therefore this problem would be solved. However in GTA02-A7 this issue was
taken care of by adding C4306/C4307 to the microphone lines [1].

C4306 in conjunction with R4305(2.2k) acts as a low-pass filter and keeps
any RF from entering the internal microphone path. It would be a good idea to 
move C4307 before R4305 to protect against RF entering the MICBIAS line at all.
However to be on the save side we could add a 0R resistor(R4310) in series to 
be able to switch back to the current configuration if necessary. 
I also would consider removing the C4307 footprint completely because it does not
participate in a noise cancellation when RF is entering the microphone path 
through MICBIAS.

Despite the above changes we still leave the C4306 footprint unpopulated. This 
is just a pre-emptive fix if ECN0018 does not archive the expected effect.
