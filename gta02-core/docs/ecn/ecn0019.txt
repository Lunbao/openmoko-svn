Consider applying buzz fix


RF feeds into the microphone line of the headset jack JK4401. This RF causes
ripples on the microphone bias line of the codec which leads to a poor audio
quality of the microphone.
One goal of the ECN0018 is to prevent any RF from reaching the wolfson codec,
therefore this problem would be solved. However in GTA02-A7 this issue was
taken care of by adding C4306/C4307 to the microphone lines. Those caps are
still defined as NC but the footprint(1206) is big enough so that a 100uF cap
can be easily mounted if necessary. Also R4303 is interchangeable with a 2.2k
resistor as mentioned in the big-C Buzz Fix [1].

I'd consider to leave those cap footprints in the circuit if the solution with
the beads fails and we still get ripple on the mic bias line.
