Getting started in gta02-core
=============================

This is a brief guide to help new participants of the gta02-core project
to get their bearings, and to help veterans to prop up their memory.


Setting things up
-----------------

- Subscribe to the gta02-core list:

  http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/gta02-core/

- Consider joining the #gta02-core channel on irc.freenode.net

- Check out the project:

  svn co https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/gta02-core/
  cd gta02-core

- You will need a recent version of KiCad. Many distributions come
  with truly ancient versions. To build KiCad,

  - download KiCad:

    svn checkout https://kicad.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kicad/trunk/kicad
    cd kicad

  - you need a recent development version of libboost (1.36 or higher)

  - you need a recent development version of wxWindows (libwxgtk-2.8)

  - Make a link to the patches of the gta02-core project:

    ln -s ../kicad-patches patches

  - Apply the patches:

    quilt push -a

  - Compile and install KiCad:

    cmake .
    make
    make install

  - we're done here, go back

    cd ..

- We draw footprints with the footprint editor fped.

  - Prerequisites:

    - bash
    - flex
    - bison
    - fig2dev
    - ImageMagick
    - Gtk+ 2.x development package (libgtk2.0-dev or similar)
    - Liberation Fonts (ttf-liberation or similar)

  - Download it:

    svn checkout http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/eda/fped

  - Build and install it:

    cd fped
    make dep all install

  - we're done here, go back

    cd ..

- Build your local copy of the component (schematics symbol) library:

  make update

  (This also updates everything to the latest SVN revision.)

- We keep a list of data sheet URLs and you can download and cache
  them locally. To do so, decide on a location for the cache, e.g.,
  /home/moko/dsv (dsv is "Data Sheet Viewer"), then

  DSV_HOME=/home/moko/dsv make dsv

  Then add $DSV_HOME/bin to your PATH, and you'll be able to view
  data sheets with commands like dsv-sc32442, dsv-cpu, etc. See
  $DSV_HOME/bin/ and components/INFO for the complete collection.

- Things to see and do:

  - (re)view and edit components (schematics symbols)

  - (re)view and edit the schematics

  - (re)view and edit the ECNs (Engineering Change Notices)

  - (re)view and edit footprints

  - (re)view and edit the layout (coming soon)


(Re)viewing and editing components
----------------------------------

Feeling lazy ? Then use the pre-built PDF link for the "expanded view"
on http://people.openmoko.org/werner/gta02-core.html

To view and edit the components, you can run eeschema in the components/
directory:

  cd components
  eeschema gta02-core-comp.sch

A shorthand for this is

  cd components
  make sch

The invoke the "Library Viewer" or the "Library Editor".

Components are kept in *.lib files in components/, one component per
library. They are merged in a combined library with the script "mkloe"
in the same directory. You usually don't invoke "mkloe" directly, but
run

  make update

in the project's top-level directory.

The review status of components is recorded in components/STATUS

Additional information, specifically links to data sheets, is in the
file components/INFO


(Re)viewing and editing schematics
----------------------------------

Feeling lazy ? Then use the pre-built PDF link for the schematics on
http://people.openmoko.org/werner/gta02-core.html

To view and edit the schematics, run KiCad on them:

  eeschema gta02-core.sch

or, if this doesn't work (older versions of KiCad),

  eeschema `pwd`/gta02-core.sch

A shorthand for this is "make sch".

The schematics are kept in the top-level directory, in files called
*.sch. Their review status is tracked in the file STATUS.

Note: when saving schematics, don't use "Save Project" but save the
page(s) you've changed with "Save". Otherwise, the timestamp on all
pages changes, which may create conflicts when submitting things or
when pulling updates.


(Re)viewing and editing ECNs
----------------------------

The ECNs are kept in docs/ecn/. Their structure is described in
docs/ecn/README. Their status is tracked in docs/ecn/STATUS.

Wherever possible and remotely useful, ECNs should be referenced in
the schematics.


(Re)viewing and editing footprints
----------------------------------

Feeling lazy ? Then use the pre-built PDF link for the modules on
http://people.openmoko.org/werner/gta02-core.html

The footprints are kept in *.fpd files in modules/. To view a footprint,
run

  fped modules/filename.fpd

To generate printable Postscript, run

  fped -p modules/filename.fpd

(writes modules/filename.ps), or

  fped -p modules/filename.fpd -

(writes to stdout.)

Footprints are translated to KiCad and merged in a combined library with
the script "mkloe" in the same directory. You usually don't invoke
"mkloe" directly, but run

  make update

in the project's top-level directory.

The review status of footprint is recorded in modules/STATUS

Additional information, specifically links to data sheets (in addition
to the ones we already have for the component itself), is in the file
modules/INFO


Making changes
--------------

When making changes, please mail a patch to the gta02-core list. After
a while, once you've made a few patches, you'll usually be given direct
commit access.

When making a major contribution, please add your name to AUTHORS.
If you do a review, please add your name to the respective STATUS file.
