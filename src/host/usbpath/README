usbpath - Convert the physical locations of a USB device to/from its number
===========================================================================

A device number is represented by the following syntax:

bus/devnum

where "bus" is the number of the USB bus, using the numbering scheme
employed by lsusb et al., and "devnum" is the number of the device on
that bus.

The physical location of a USB device is represented by the following
syntax:

bus-port. ... .port

where "bus" is again the number of the USB bus, and "port" is the number
of the port on the respective next hub, counting from one.


usbport converts between the two representations.

Example:
usbport 1/19
1-1.2

usbport 1-1.2
1/19
