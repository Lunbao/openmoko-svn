usbreset - Reset one or all USB devices
=======================================

"usbreset" performs a USB bus reset for one or all devices.

If invoked without arguments, all devices on all USB busses are reset.

If a bus/devnum pair is specified, only that device is reset. The bus
and device number can be obtained with lsusb. E.g.,

# lsusb
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 047d:101f Kensington PocketMouse Pro
# usbreset 1/5

would reset the mouse in this example.
