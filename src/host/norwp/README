Known issues
------------

Something's wrong with the communication with the FT2232 chip. We have
to send commands several times before they have an effect.

OpenOCD doesn't have that problem, so it's something that's wrong in
norwp.c

Querying the state of NOR_WP only works after the line has been
configured as an output. After board reset, the state is not clearly
defined, and we may read back "rw" even though the board may not be
protected.
