Introduction
============

This kit is meant to be used with the prebuilt openmoko toolchain to
ease the effort to develop on openmoko platform.


Prerequisites
=============

Must install openmoko toolchain in absolute path /usr/local/openmoko
For instructions about how to get/install it, please refer to

http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Toolchain


Quick start
===========

In your home directory:

$ cp -r /usr/local/openmoko/source/openmoko-sample2 ~/
$ . /usr/local/openmoko/arm/setup-env
$ om-conf openmoko-sample2
$ om-make-ipkg openmoko-sample2

Now you got openmoko-sample2_0.1_armv4t.ipk , you can `scp' it to your
neo and install it:

$ scp openmoko-sample2_0.1_armv4t.ipk root@192.168.0.202:
$ ssh root@192.168.0.202 ipkg install openmoko-sample2_0.1_armv4t.ipk


User configuraion
=================

  * May edit variables in scripts/script-env

  * If the application need extra configure or autoreconf arguments,
    they could be specified when executing `conf.sh':
