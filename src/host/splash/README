Splash screen support
=====================

This is a description of the original splash screen setup process. We
use the somewhat arcane JTAG upload method. Please check the OpenMoko
Wiki for the updated and presumably more friendly instructions.


Prerequities
------------

The u-boot running on the Neo must be from SVN revision 1061 or later.
A reasonably recent version of Netpbm must be installed on the host. We
assume that you have JTAG and openocd set up.


Generating the splash image
---------------------------

The splash image is a raw dump of the 480x640x16 frame buffer, with RGB
5:6:5 organization and HWSWP = 1. To save a lot of space and to greatly
improve speed, we gzip the raw dump.

- Download the official startup screen:
  wget http://wiki.openmoko.org/images/c/c2/System_boot.png

- Generate the compressed frame buffer dump:
  ./splashimg.pl | gzip -9 >splash.gz


Put the image into NAND Flash
-----------------------------

We use JTAG to upload the image into memory, then write it to Flash with
u-boot. (Note: we assume that the image is not larger then 0x5000 bytes.
If there is a size change, update these instructions accordingly.)

- Start u-boot and enter the prompt.

- With openocd, load the image into memory:
  halt
  load_binary wherever/splash.gz 0x32000000
  resume

- In u-boot, write it to NAND Flash:
  nand erase splash
  nand write.e 0x32000000 splash 0x5000

- Set up the environment to load the splash screen:
  setenv splashimage nand read.e 0x32000000 splash 0x5000\; unzip 0x32000000 0x33d00000 0x96000
  saveenv

After a reboot, the splash screen image will be displayed.
