This is openmoko-taskmanager application.

usage:
1. install patch for matchbox-window-manager-1.* (more see README in patch), and then reninstall your matchbox-window-manager-1.*.

2. install openmoko-taskmanager 

make sure the openmoko-taskmanager works under matchbox-window-manager-1.*, which has been patched.

NOTE: an unpatched matchbox-window-manager-1.* will make the application inefficent.

HOWTO run the application:
openmoko-taskmanager will be launched when openmoko-footer's left button clicked. so before you use this application, you must make sure you have intalled the openmoko-footer correctly (more see README of openmoko-footer), or a more straight way is that you can test it in a terminal, but make sure you have run matchbox window manager first.
