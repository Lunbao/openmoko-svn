	* applications/openmoko-today/src/today-events-area.c:
	  Do not use ECalComponent anymore, but rather
	  the underlying icalcomponent.
	  ECalComponent was actually useless and was
	  just eating more memory.
	* applications/openmoko-today/src/today-utils.c,h:
	  ditto.
	  Added icalcomponent_has_alarm() to detect if an
	  icalcomponent has alarms.

	* applications/openmoko-today/src/today-events-area.c:
	  move utils functions into
	  applications/openmoko-today/src/today-utils.[c|h].
	  Get todo items as well.
	  Render todo items, events, and alarmed event using
	  the theme icons.
	* applications/openmoko-today/src/today-utils.c: move util functions in
	  here

	* applications/openmoko-today/src/today-events-area.c,h:
	  add a bunch a GObject properties for all the getters/setters.
	  Use g_object_new() in the constructors.
	  Add a today_events_area_new_from_events() for better convenience.
	* applications/openmoko-today/src/today-main.c: use the
	  new today_events_area_new_from_events() method.

	* applications/openmoko-today/src/today-events-area.c:
	  today_events_area_get_nb_pages(): new function
	  When events get added, compute the widget name accordingly.
	  The widget name depends on wheter there are multiple event
	  pages in the widget or not. Based on that name, the widget
	  will use an appropriate post-it widget.

	* src/today-events-area.c: don't forget to emit the signal
	  events-added, when edited.

Thu, 15 Mar 2007 12:44:51 +0100 Dodji Seketeli

	* src/today-events-area.c,h: expose signals
	  event-added, event-selected, page-switched.
	  Make the internals use these.
          added today_events_area_switch_to_prev_page() and
	  today_events_area_switch_to_next_page().

	* src/today-events-area.c,h: initial attempt at coding an
	EventArea widget that takes a list of ECalComponent representing
	a list of event and showing these events "page by page".
	You can select events, and cycle through the event pages.
	* src/today-main.c: use the new EventArea widget for testing
	For now,the code loads all the events from the calendar, not only
	those of today. This is just to test the paging code.
	* tests/events-area-test.c: a small test program for the widget
