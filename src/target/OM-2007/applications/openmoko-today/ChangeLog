	* src/today-events-area.c,h: initial attempt at coding an
	EventArea widget that takes a list of ECalComponent representing
	a list of event and showing these events "page by page".
	You can select events, and cycle through the event pages.
	* src/today-main.c: use the new EventArea widget for testing
	For now,the code loads all the events from the calendar, not only
	those of today. This is just to test the paging code.
	* tests/events-area-test.c: a small test program for the widget
