First try to get a Gtk+ GUI for libmrss


Known design flaws:
    -No real model for the feed
    -No proxy model that makes use of the filter
    -No caching of images
    -Storage size is not limited
    -There is no way to merge feed entries from two planets... instead two entries will be presented
     (this is another reason for a better model)
    -Separate MRSS, Model and CellRender allocation into a model manager class which
     knows the secret of the used types, the to be used cell renderer and the sort

Main objective:
    -Get familiar with the joy/pain of Gtk+
