        * scripts/prepare-ChangeLog: Added.

2007-03-20: Fix the size of the column headers
	Combat the GtkTreeViewColumn sizing

2007-03-20: Parse content of atom feeds manually
	Parse content of ATOM feeds manually. Avoid setting NULL text inside the
	GtkTextBuffer. Store content type and source inside the ListStore as well.

2007-03-20: Fetch feeds inside a GThread
	Fetching the feeds was implemented inside a GThread. gdk_threads_init et
	alk is called and this works as long as AT-SPI is not enabled. If it is
	enabled the application will eventuall crash.
	Ekiga has the same trouble and it is documented as bug #329454 inside the
	GNOME bug tracker.
