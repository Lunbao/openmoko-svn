        Start implementing the test (untested)

        * src/moko_cache.c:
        (moko_cache_create_dirs): Make sure to create the dir. Somehow there
        is no recursive mkdir in glib 
        (moko_cache_create_path): Create/build a path for the cache
        (object_name_to_file_name): sanitize the object name. e.g.
        http://wwww.example.org/feed.xml and escape the ':', '/' and other
        characthers
        (moko_cache_write_object): Implement
        (moko_cache_read_object): Implement
        * src/moko_cache.h: switch from gint to gsize for the size

2007-05-03  Holger Freyther  <zecke@selfish.org>

        * src/callbacks.c:
        (cb_treeview_keypress_event): Cursor keys are not forwarded to the
        search bar but are left to the TreeView

        * src/rfcdate.h: s/obj/klass/ in the macro. (fixlet)

2007-04-29  Holger Hans Peter Freyther  <zecke@selfish.org>

        Add a class to handle caching of feeds while making sure not consuming
		too much space. This class is meant to be copied to mokocore once done

        * src/Makefile.am: Add moko_cache.[h,c]
        * src/moko_cache.c: Added.
        (moko_cache_finalize): Clean the filename
        (moko_cache_class_init): Make sure to clean the filename
        (moko_cache_init): Initialize it
        (moko_cache_new): Copy the profile name
        (moko_cache_get_allowed_size): not implemented
        (moko_cache_get_utilized_size): not implemtned
        (moko_cache_write_object): not implemented
        (moko_cache_read_object): not implemented

2007-04-29  Holger Hans Peter Freyther  <zecke@selfish.org>

        * src/rfcdate.c: Handle wrong dates
        (rss_rfc_date_set): If we can't parse set it to 26.01.1983
        (rss_rfc_date_compare): Check if the dates we pass to g_date_compae
are valid

2007-04-29  Holger Hans Peter Freyther  <zecke@selfish.org>

        * src/callbacks.c: Update documentation, move it around
        (feed_update_thread): Update documentation
        (cb_treeview_selection_changed): make the string i18nable

2007-04-29  Holger Hans Peter Freyther  <zecke@selfish.org>

        * src/rfcdate.h: Add a proper license header

2007-04-29  Holger Hans Peter Freyther  <zecke@selfish.org>

        * src/rfcdate.c: Do not include malloc.h as this is not portable

2007-04-29  Holger Hans Peter Freyther  <zecke@selfish.org>

        * scripts/prepare-ChangeLog: Added.

2007-03-20: Fix the size of the column headers
	Combat the GtkTreeViewColumn sizing

2007-03-20: Parse content of atom feeds manually
	Parse content of ATOM feeds manually. Avoid setting NULL text inside the
	GtkTextBuffer. Store content type and source inside the ListStore as well.

2007-03-20: Fetch feeds inside a GThread
	Fetching the feeds was implemented inside a GThread. gdk_threads_init et
	alk is called and this works as long as AT-SPI is not enabled. If it is
	enabled the application will eventuall crash.
	Ekiga has the same trouble and it is documented as bug #329454 inside the
	GNOME bug tracker.
