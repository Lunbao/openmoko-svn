		Application Manager README
		==========================

Introduction
============

Application manager is an "ipk packages" management program. It's 
based on the libmokoui and libipkg. It will hopefully make the process
 of installing/removing/upgrading packages on neo-1973 become more 
easy. 


Building
========
To build the application manager, you should follow the steps:
	./autogen.sh
	make
	make install

The application manager needs the libmokoui and libipkg(0.99.163 and
with the is-processing.patch) to build. The configure script (in the
autogen scirpt) will detect these. The autogen script need the 
automake tools.

At many times, your build system and running system are different,
you should rewrite the autogen script when need.
