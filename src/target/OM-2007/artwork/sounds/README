OPENMOKO SOUNDS by Marek "Wansti" MÃ¶ckel

File types:

	.rg  - music "source" files in Rosegarden's native format
	.wav - Rendered music in uncompressed Wave format
	.mp3, .ogg - Wave files compressed with LAME/Ogg Vorbis


License:

	Unless a different license type is required for OpenMoko all files
	are released under the CreativeCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
	license.


Tools I used:

	All tunes have been composed in Rosegarden (an OpenSource MIDI
	sequencer available at www.rosegardenmusic.com), rendered on a
	Yamaha Motif ES tone generator and recorded using Audacity or
	Ardour.
	If you would like to modify the tunes, please keep in mind that
	rendering the .rg files on a different tone generator will most
	likely produce very different (maybe better :-P) results. MIDI
	files are available on request, or can be created using Rosegarden's
	export function.


Please also see TODO for a list of necessary/requested changes.
