  The application will have a more better layout when running 
on the Matchbox-panel than other panels.
  Two action of the plugin:
  1. tab (click): launch openmoko-clock, which will write 
later, now what i do is launch "/usr/games/same-gnome".
  2. tab with hold: show time in different format, 12-hours 
and 24-hours.
