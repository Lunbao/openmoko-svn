UNDER DEVELOPMENT - DON'T USE YET

u-boot build scripts
====================

This is a collection of scripts to build u-boot. This is the "manual" build
process, which only needs a cross-toolchain, but nothing else from OpenEmbedded
or any similar environment.

They're mainly intended as examples for how the process works and aren't
necessarily useful "as is" for daily work:

build
  Build u-boot from scratch, using either the latest or some specific
  version from the u-boot upstream sources (git) and the OpenMoko patches
  (SVN).

update
  Update the u-boot sources to either the latest or some specific version.


Toolchain
---------

We use the OpenEmbedded EABI toolchain. Below is are instructions for a
quick minimal setup for the purpose of building u-boot and the kernel.
More detailed instructions can be found here:

# If the host is 64 bit (x86_64):
DL=http://downloads.openmoko.org/
wget $DL/toolchains/openmoko-x86_64-arm-linux-gnueabi-toolchain.tar.bz2
tar xCfj / openmoko-x86_64-arm-linux-gnueabi-toolchain.tar.bz2 

# If the host is 32 bit (i686):
DL=http://downloads.openmoko.org/
wget $DL/toolchains/openmoko-i686-arm-linux-gnueabi-toolchain.tar.bz2
tar xCfj / openmoko-i686-arm-linux-gnueabi-toolchain.tar.bz2 

# Then set the PATH with:
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/openmoko/arm/bin
