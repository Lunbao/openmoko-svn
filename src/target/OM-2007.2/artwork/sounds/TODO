OPENMOKO SOUNDS - TODO LIST

Feel free to add your own comments or requests here.


Changes:

	-There Is No Phone and Ring'n'Roll are too silent compared to the
	 others. The ending of Ring'n'Roll needs more treble since the low
	 frequencies are hardly audible on the small speaker.
	-The transition parts in Squirrels and Supertux don't work well;
	 they're too silent so that it sounds as if the phone has stopped
	 ringing if it's carried in a pocket or lying around at a distance.
	-Notify sounds should be shorter and less intrusive. Maybe reducing
	 the volume will already help.


Additions:

	-Startup will have a voice saying "Welcome to OpenMoko" mixed into it.
	-Themes of matching tones for sms, notify, error, ringtone, etc.
	-More sounds. :-)
