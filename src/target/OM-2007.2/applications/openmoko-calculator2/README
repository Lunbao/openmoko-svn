Simple calculator, started based on the OpenMoko Finger Application
example and the OpenMoko regular dialer UI, in the hope that it would
be useful.

Notes:
 * Pango markup is used currently to manage font size for the display,
   maybe styles would be more appropriate.

Thank you for your attention,
