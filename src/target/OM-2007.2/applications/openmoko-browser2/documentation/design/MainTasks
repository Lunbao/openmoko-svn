= Main Tasks for an Embedded/Mobile Browser to be used with your thumb =

-) Open a URL
-) Visit a bookmarked site, add bookmarks
-) Easily navigate and get an overview of the page
-) Have more than one page open at a time
-) Fullscreen browsing
-) Gestures



Tasks in depth:

== Open a URL ==

It should be easy to navigate to a new URL. The new URL could be opened
in a new window/tab/XYZ or replace a current page.
Ideally the OpenURL dialog/window is fullscreen, features auto completion
for the entered URL and will show a list of bookmarks below the entry. When
clicking on a bookmark it should show up in the URL entry and can be edited further.


== Visit a bookmarked site, add bookmarks ==
Bookmarks:
    We will allow to keep a hierachy of Bookmarked sites. The bookmark consists out of a icon
    (by default the favorite icon of the site), a URL to be navigated to and a small
    text to be shown to the user.

Adding a bookmark:
    Adding a bookmark should be possible with a thumb press. By default the current
    favorite icon, the URL should be used. The entering of a text is optional. In case
    of adding an already existing bookmark we will use the already existing icon+name
    and allow to edit.
    The add dialog will allow to create new folders as well. The hierachy can be chosen
    using a ComboBox with the subdirectories being indented in the display.

Ordering of bookmarsk:
    It should be possible to change the order/rang of a bookmark by drag and drop. This
    should be able to be triggered from the Bookmark tab as well.
    Having a hierachy makes it more tough to move bookmars around in the hierachy. There
    are two modes to do so. Using the editing menu which will be shown on "Right-On-Hold"
    or by dragging and dropping along the hierachy of the bookmark view.

Visiting Bookmarked sites:
    On one click a grid/icon-view of bookmarks should be presented on the screen. The
    grid should be of a fixed size and it should be possible to go to the next, previous
    site.
    The grid will be reachable using the GtkNotebook of the MainWindow. There will be one
    GtkNotebook page for the bookmarks. And instead of having a start site the 
    bookmark page will be shown.

== Easily navigate and get an overview of the page ==

One click should trigger a whole page view, and having a rect in the size of the viewport to
control which area should be seen.

== Have more than one page open at a time ==

Some form of tab browsing. Probably similiar to the bookmark screen to show a list of open
windows in a small, but not too small preview.

== FullScreen browsing ==

With one click it should be possible to use the fullscreen for browsing. The question is how
to toggle back without having to use a keyboard. One option would be to have a fixed point on the screen,
another would be to have gestures. But they must not conflict with MokoFingerScroll window.
(Implementation is postponed)

== Gestures ==

The gestures should not conflict with MokoFingerScroll, should probably be similiar to the simple XStroke
implementation and should be used for the following options.
We will allow to define the corners (my screen has eight corners) and their actions, by default they will
not conflict with the MokoFingerScroll.
