= General Interface (MainWindow) =
To follow the OpenMoko style guidelines we will be using a GtkNotebook
with the following pages "Current Page", "Bookmark Page", "Go Page", 
"Select Page" and "Settings Page".
When the application will be launched the default page to show is the "Bookmark
Page".

== Current Page ==
The current page will be viewed in this "GtkNotebook page". To select
another of the already opened pages visit "Select Page".

The toolbar will have five entries and up to 8 gestures.

Toolbar:
    Forward
    Backward
    Stop/Reload
    Adding a bookmark
    Close

Gestures:
    Page-Overview. Zoom out to give a full page overview
    Zoom-in
    Zoom-out
    


== Go Page ==
It should be possible to replace the content of a page and be able
to create new pages. This is why we will have a very simple input
dialog to enter a URL/Search (hopefully assisted by the input method)
and the option to open it in a new page or replace the current. E.g. this
currently means that bookmarks are either opened in a new page or replace
the current one. If it would replace the current page there must be an
easy way to create a new blank page, so currently bookmarks will open in
new pages.

Discussion:
    Entry Completion:
        The proposal is to not remember every page but only the
        pages that are in the bookmark-list and the pages that
        got directly entered. The order should be to show the domain names
        first and then after showing each domain other entries with the
        path will be shown.

    Bookmark and Go:
        


== Select Page ==
Show all opened pages in a grid and allow to switch the current tab.


== Bookmark Page ==
Allow to open a bookmarked page. This page will be opened and made current. It is
also possible to manage the bookmark page by removing, reordering and renaming
entries.

We will have a MokoSearchBar but currently have not discussed if we want to have
a search for the bookmarks. The combobox will be used to navigate the bookmark
hierachy.
Below a grid with bookmarks will be shown. This grid will have an "up" button on the
left when we are inside a hierachy. You can also navigate upwards or to remembered
places using the Combobox of the Bookmark Page.


== Settings Page ==
To be discussed



= Closing Dialogs/Widgets =
Using the close hardware button will be used to close the widget.
