Better selection handling!

    Try to keep the item selected across updates. This means
    before and after a search the same item should be selected.
    The same applies to filters, etc.

    Gtk+ is not making this easy. In Qt you would have a persistent
    model index, with Gtk+ it looks like there is no way to find out
    if a GtkTreeIter is still valid.
