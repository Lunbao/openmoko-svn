This is the OpenMoko media player for OM2007.2, enabling you to playback audio
(and eventually video) on your smartphone.

It stores XSPF playlists in ~/playlists and uses the SD card as media storage
by default. Please be aware that there are issues still - especially when it
comes to the user interface. They'll be fixed however, so bear with me :)
