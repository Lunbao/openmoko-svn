usage: dynenv device [pointer]

"dynenv" reads or writes the pointer that indicates to u-boot from which
NAND location to load the environment. This pointer is stored in the OOB
area of the first page of the NAND Flash.

"device" is the device containing the first page of the NAND. "pointer"
is the new value to write. "pointer" follows the usual C notation.

Examples:

# dynenv /dev/mtd1
# dynenv /dev/mtd1 0x40000
# dynenv /dev/mtd1 0x`awk '/mtd1/{print $2}' </proc/mtd`

(Note that the NAND Flash starts with /dev/mtd1 on GTA02 but with
/dev/mtd0 on GTA01.)
