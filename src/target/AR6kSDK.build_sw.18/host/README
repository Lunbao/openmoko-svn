A) Code Organization
B) Building the code and loading the Driver

A) Code organization

The host side code for different platforms is organized as follows:
1) os: Captures the os specific dependencies. The network adaptor driver is implemented in this directory.
2) wmi: Implements the wireless module interface.
3) htc: Implements the host transport communication interface.
4) hif: Implements the host interconnect framework for different interfaces.
6) tools: Contains the implementation for several tools used to interact with the wlan driver.
7) wlan: Implements some utility functions related to the core wireless lan.
8) sdiostack: Contains the sources for the SDIO/SPI stack.
9) bmi: Implements the bootloader messaging interface.
10) support: Contains scripts to load the driver and control some aspects of the wlan device using the tools present in the tools directory.

B) Building the code
   -----------------
  cd into the top-level directory of the distribution
  Set environment variables (also see host/localmake.linux.inc):
      export WORKAREA=`pwd`  [Note: Use backticks, not quote marks]
      export ATH_BUILD_TYPE=LOCAL_i686
      export ATH_LINUXPATH=/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-2.6.9/linux-2.6.9  [Note: This is an example]
      export ATH_BUS_TYPE=SDIO
      export ATH_HC_DRIVERS=pci_std/
      export ATH_PLATFORM=$ATH_BUILD_TYPE-$ATH_BUS_TYPE

  Build device driver and support tools:
      make -C host

  Load the wireless driver on your system:
     host/support/loadAR6000.sh

  Configure the wireless network interface with ifconfig and iwconfig.
  For example:
     ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.99 up
     iwconfig eth1 essid "MyAccessPointSSID"
