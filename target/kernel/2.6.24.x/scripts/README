Kernel build scripts
====================

This is a collection of scripts to build the Linux kernel. This is the "manual"
build process, which only needs a cross-toolchain and u-boot, but nothing else
from OpenEmbedded or any similar environment.

They're mainly intended as examples for how the process works and aren't
necessarily useful "as is" for daily work:

build
  Build the kernel from scratch, using either the latest or some specific
  version from the ftp.kernel.org kernel (HTTP) and the OpenMoko patches (SVN).

update
  Update the kernel sources to either the latest or some specific SVN version.


Toolchain
---------

We use the OpenEmbedded EABI toolchain. See
../../../../../../trunk/src/target/u-boot/scripts/README
for details.


Environment variables
---------------------

See "build".
